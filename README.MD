# Self Driving Car Simulation using Udacity Self driving car simulator

## Self driving car drive automatically without the help of human.
## Components of Self driving car
 -Computer vision
 -Sensor fusion
 -Localization
 -Path planning
 -Control


 ## Self driving car simulation using udacity seld driving car simulator
 ## steps:
 1.collecting data:
 ###We have collected data using simulatr (Around 3-5k images i.e center,rightand left images and steering angle,speed,throatal etc.)
 
 2.data preprocessing
 ###We have clean and transform data that is suitable for model

 3.Split data into training and testing
 ##The data is split into training and testing

 4.Model creation
 ###We have create CNN model i.e proposed by nvdia with the helf of tensorflow.

 5.Training Model
 ###We traing model with train data with 0.01 loss in

 6.Testing model with udacity simulator
 ###We run CNN model on udacity simulator
